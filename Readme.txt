Readme
Overview
This project involves the development and analysis of a neural network model for classifying sonar signals into either rocks or mines. The dataset contains patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off metal cylinders and rocks under varying conditions. The neural network is implemented using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework.
Dataset
The dataset consists of two files:
* sonar.mines: Contains 111 patterns obtained from metal cylinders.
* sonar.rocks: Contains 97 patterns obtained from rocks.
Each pattern consists of 60 numerical values representing energy levels within specific frequency bands. These values are derived from frequency-modulated chirp sonar signals. Labels ("R" for rock and "M" for mine) indicate the object's classification and are associated with each pattern.
Neural Network Architecture
The implemented neural network follows this architecture:
* Input Layer: 60 neurons, corresponding to the number of features.
* Hidden Layers: Four hidden layers, each with 60 neurons and using different activation functions (RELU and sigmoid).
* Output Layer: Two neurons, representing rock ("R") and mine ("M") classes respectively.
Hyperparameters
To train the model effectively, the following hyperparameters are set:
* Learning Rate: 0.2
* Number of Epochs: 500
* Number of Hidden Layers: 4
* Number of Neurons per Hidden Layer: 60
* Batch Size: Full-batch training
Training and Evaluation
The training process involves TensorFlow's Gradient Descent optimizer. The cost (cross-entropy loss) and accuracy are tracked for each epoch. The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to quantify prediction accuracy.
Results
* The cost decreases over epochs, indicating convergence.
* Test accuracy provides insight into the model's classification performance.
* The computed MSE quantifies prediction accuracy.
Files Included
* sonar_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the neural network implementation and analysis.
* sonar.all-data.csv: The original dataset in CSV format.
* README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Usage
1. Install the necessary libraries using pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn.
2. Run the sonar_classification.ipynb notebook to train the model and analyze the results.
Conclusion
This project showcases the application of neural networks for classifying sonar signals based on the provided dataset. The code and report outline the implementation steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. Further improvements can involve hyperparameter tuning and exploring alternative architectures.
